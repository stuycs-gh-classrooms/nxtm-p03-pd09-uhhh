This project will be completed in phases. The first phase will be to work on this document. Use github-flavoured markdown. (For more markdown help [click here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) or [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) )

All projects will require the following:
- Researching new forces to implement.
- Method for each new force, returning a `PVector`  -- similar to `getGravity` and `getSpring` (using whatever parameters are necessary).
- A distinct demonstration for each individual force (including gravity and the spring force).
- A visual menu at the top providing information about which simulation is currently active and indicating whether movement is on or off.
- The ability to toggle movement on/off
- The ability to toggle bouncing on/off
- The user should be able to switch _between_ simluations using the number keys as follows:
  - `1`: Gravity
  - `2`: Spring Force
  - `3`: Drag
  - `4`: Custom Force
  - `5`: Combination


## Phase 0: Force Selection, Analysis & Plan
---------- 

#### Custom Force: Electro Static Force

### Custom Force Formula
What is the formula for your force? Including descriptions/definitions for the symbols. (You may include a picture of the formula if it is not easily typed.)

 F=k∣q1q2∣r^2
 
- F	Electrostatic force (in Newtons, N)

- k	Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.987×109 N m2/C2

- 8.987×10^9N m^2/C^2

- q1​	Charge of the first object (in Coulombs, C)

- q2​	Charge of the second object (in Coulombs, C)

- r	Distance between the centers of the two charges (in meters, m)


What information that is already present in the `Orb` or `OrbNode` classes does this force use?

Radius, the distance between two orbs. 

Does this force require any new constants, if so what are they and what values will you try initially?

No

- Does this force require any new information to be added to the `Orb` class? If so, what is it and what data type will you use?

k	Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.987×10^9 N m^2/C^2

- Does this force interact with other `Orbs`, or is it applied based on the environment?
- 
Yes, based on the charges. The orbs will each be given a charge based on the mass, then the electorstatic force will be calculated based on those charges.

- In order to calculate this force, do you need to perform extra intermediary calculations? If so, what?

Yes, we would need to find the force of each orb. 

--- 

### Simulation 1: Gravity
Describe how you will attempt to simulate orbital motion

Give each orb a unique charge. Then use the coulobm's formula to find the force presented. This force will replicate the simultaion of an orbital motion. 

--- 

### Simulation 2: Spring
Describe what your spring simulation will look like. Explain how it will be setup, and how it should behave while running.

We will use the spring to represent the distance between the center of each orb, compress and extend depending on the condition. 

--- 

### Simulation 3: Drag
Describe what your drag simulation will look like. Explain how it will be setup, and how it should behave while running.

simulate drag by slowing down each orb based on its velocity. The faster the orb moves, the stronger the drag force applied in the opposite direction

--- 

### Simulation 4: Electro Static Force
Describe what your Custom force simulation will look like. Explain how it will be setup, and how it should behave while running.

Orbs with the same charges repel, oppsite attract. 

Add charge

Add getElectricForce()

Add applyElectricForces()

--- 

### Simulation 5: Combination
Combine gravity, spring force, drag, and electro static force together. Orbs will be attracted/repel to each other based on the charge and also experiencing resistance from drag.
